# kristinMcRyanVdeProject2

Welcome to Project Glamour! 

A Project created to showcase the javascript, sass, css, and html skills of two aspiring front-end developers Kristin McCollum and Ryan Van Den Eeckhout.

The project was built to showcase the collaborative efforts of the two students during a pair programming project that integrates the use of a REST API during the period. 

Data was supplied by Juno's own created Makeup API which supplies data on a variety of products and brands such as Almay, Alva, Anna sui, Annabelle, Clinique, iman, l'oreal, Lotus cosmetics USA, Maia's mineral galaxy, Marcelle, Milani, Mineral fusion, Misa, Mistura, Nyx, Orly, Pacifica, Penny lane organics to name but a few of the brands available. Furthermore, this project supports the looking up of these products under the product catogories of Lipstick, Blush, Bronzer, Eyeliner, Eyeshadow, Foundation and Lipliner to help you narrow down your search and to help find your own unique style!
